		<h2>Hier steht mehr zu mir:</h2>
<p>Ursula Graber was born in Graz where she grew up being in touch with music
and arts, since all her family members were musicians. She started to play the
piano at the age of 8 and attended a high school with the focus on music where
she did her first dance steps. After that she started to dance classical ballet
and soon got passionate about it. At the same time she enjoyed the thorough
education in music, which nourished her dancing and vice-versa.</p>

<p>When she was 15 she spent a year in Peru and engaged in her passion for
languages. Once finished the High-School, she deepened her linguistic skills
studying Roman Philology/Spanish in Graz and took classes on a variety of dance
styles and theatre, especially Contemporary Dance.</p>

<p>After receiving her Bachelor degree in Spanish she decided to go for
Contemporary Dance professionally and enrolled for the Contemporary Dance BA
in Linz, Austria. During those studies she developed a profound grasp of
contemporary technique and important elements of dance pedagogy. Moreover she
danced within her studies for several Choreographers like Alan Danielson, Regina
van Berkel, Eldad Ben Sasson, Annette Lopez Leal, Aneta Zwierzynska, Dante Murillo,
Editta Braun and Jianan Qu. Beside the program she engaged in creating her own
works together with Vilte Svarplyte.</p>

<p>During the training-based program in Linz Ursula searched for an artistic,
experimental and interdisciplinary learning space and found her needs met in
the 'laboratory school' Manufacture, Lausanne. She went there first as an
Exchange student. Given that being there was so precious for her as well as
for them, the institution continuously found ways to extend her visit. She
ended up staying for the three years.</p>

<p>During this diverse 3 years program with a vast variety of teachers from
different art fields, which focused on creation and supporting the students
to find their own artistic practice and way, Ursula developed four works. At
the end of the program she toured as a dancer with Fabrice Mazliah within the
Swiss Dance festival STEPS, an international contemporary dance festival that
invites dance companies from all around the world, on a tour through Switzerland.</p>

<p>Outside of the study program, Ursula broadens her dance skills regularly in
festivals and workshops: Camping in Paris 2017, Impulstanz in Vienna 2018, as
well as various workshops in Contact Improvisation and Axis Syllabus.</p>

<p>In addition to her dance path, Ursula pursues her passion for Jazz singing
and takes regularly classes since 2014 (with Ines Rom, Simona Kazakeviciute,
Agnes Heginger, Anne Montandon, Fabrice Hayoz and Francine Acolas).</p>

<p>Thanks to different stays abroad and her passion for cultures and languages,
Ursula speaks today 6 ½ languages fluently: German, English, Spanish, Italian,
Catalan, French plus the basics of Portuguese.</p>
