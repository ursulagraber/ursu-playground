					<p>She started to play the
					piano at the age of 8 and attended a high school with the focus on music where
					she did her first dance steps. After that she started to dance classical ballet
					and soon got passionate about it. At the same time she enjoyed the thorough
					education in music, which nourished her dancing and vice-versa.
					</p>

					<p>After receiving her Bachelor degree in Spanish she decided to go for
					Contemporary Dance professionally and enrolled for the Contemporary Dance BA
					in Linz, Austria. During those studies she developed a profound grasp of
					contemporary technique and important elements of dance pedagogy. Moreover she
					danced within her studies for several Choreographers like Alan Danielson, Regina
					van Berkel, Eldad Ben Sasson, Annette Lopez Leal, Aneta Zwierzynska, Dante Murillo,
					Editta Braun and Jianan Qu. Beside the program she engaged in creating her own
					works together with Vilte Svarplyte.</p>

					<p>During the training-based program in Linz Ursula searched for an artistic,
					experimental and interdisciplinary learning space and found her needs met in
					the 'laboratory school' Manufacture, Lausanne. She went there first as an
					Exchange student. Given that being there was so precious for her as well as
					for them, the institution continuously found ways to extend her visit. She
					ended up staying for the three years.</p>

					<p>During this diverse 3 years program with a vast variety of teachers from
					different art fields, which focused on creation and supporting the students
					to find their own artistic practice and way, Ursula developed four works. At
					the end of the program she toured as a dancer with Fabrice Mazliah within the
					Swiss Dance festival STEPS, an international contemporary dance festival that
					invites dance companies from all around the world, on a tour through Switzerland.</p>

					<p>Outside of the study program, Ursula broadens her dance skills regularly in
					festivals and workshops: Camping in Paris 2017, Impulstanz in Vienna 2018, as
					well as various workshops in Contact Improvisation and Axis Syllabus.</p>

					<p>In addition to her dance path, Ursula pursues her passion for Jazz singing
					and takes regularly classes since 2014 (with Ines Rom, Simona Kazakeviciute,
					Agnes Heginger, Anne Montandon, Fabrice Hayoz and Francine Acolas).</p>

					<p>Thanks to different stays abroad and her passion for cultures and languages,
					Ursula speaks today 6 ½ languages fluently: German, English, Spanish, Italian,
					Catalan, French plus the basics of Portuguese.</p>
