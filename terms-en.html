  We would like to point out that the transmission of data over the Internet (e.g., when communicating via e-mail) may lead to security breaches. Complete data protection against third party access is not possible. <br>

      <strong>Cookies</strong><br>
      Some of the websites use so-called cookies. Cookies do not harm your
       computer and do not contain viruses. Cookies serve to make our offer easier
       to use, more effective and safer. Cookies are small text files that are stored
       on your computer and saved by your browser. <br>
       Most of the cookies we use are called "session cookies". They are automatically removed after your visit.
        Other cookies remain stored on your device until you delete them. These cookies
        let us recognize your browser the next time you visit. <br>
    You can configurate your browser to be informed about cookie settings and only allow

      <strong>External links and content </strong><br>
      The publisher does not identify itself with the content of external websites (links) and does not assume any of them
       responsibility. At the time the links were placed on external websites, no
       had illegal content. There is no editorial review of these links.
       The content and structure of the entire website are protected by copyright. All of the
       content is for personal information. We are not responsible for any damage resulting from the use of
       website content.  <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Google Fonts</strong><br>
      This website integrates external sources of Google Fonts. Google Fonts is a service of Google Inc.
       (USA). Fonts are integrated through a Google server call in the US,
       so it can be assumed that Google saves the requests. <br>
       You can learn more about Google fonts at
        https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq#what-does-using-the-google-fonts-api-mean-for-the-privacy-of -my- users or data protection information from Google at https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>SSL encryption  </strong><br>
      This site uses SSL encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of
       confidential content, such as inquiries you send us as a site operator. You can
       recognize an encrypted connection because the browser address line changes from
       "http: //" to "https: //" and by the browser line lock symbol.  <br>
      If SSL encryption is enabled, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties. <br>
