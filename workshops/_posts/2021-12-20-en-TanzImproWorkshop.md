## The 5 steps:

<br>

## step 1: get to know your body better
## step 2: explore dance and movement
## step 3: create improv movements
## step 4: study the principles of improv
## step 5: find your own flow and magic

<br>


## step 1: get to know your body better
At Level 1 we learn about the basics of movement, gravity and breathing.
 **Motto: ENJOY**

## step 2: explore dance and movement
Through movement chains we explore specific dance movements and their parameters on level 2. **Motto: PLEASURE OF MOVING**

## step 3: create improv movements
In level 3 we become familiar with the basics of improvisation and create our own dance movements. **Motto: CHALLENGE YOURSELF, PLAY**

## step 4: study the principles of improv
Building on this, we study improv factors such as time, space and music. We also learn what to do when we are not inspired.  **Motto: DELIGHTFUL DETAILS**

## step 5: find your own flow and magic
In level 5 we combine everything we have learned into a big whole. We train to find magic and flow with the help of specific exercises. **Motto: MAGIC AND FLOW**

<br>

## the goal
You are able to move in authentic improvisations, full of variety and diversity. With that you get to know your own possibilities as a mover and get concrete ideas how to adapt and expand them.
<br>

## target group/ audience
dancers, athletes and everyone who wants to deepen their relationship to movement and their locomotory system. If you want to find your own style and personal movements instead of copying some steps, this is the right place for you.


<br>

## If these ideas appeal to you, the workshop is for you
• The social aspect of dancing together: Because it's nice to train and dance together with other people <br>
• The beauty of learning: because it is exciting and inspiring to learn something new<br>
• he health and well-being factor: Because you feel good and fit when you move, it has a relaxing effect and endorphins are produced - and because dancing has always been a part of human life <br>
*#playing with movement*

<br>

## That's what you'll get
• You feel more "in" your body..<br>
• You get a better understanding on how to move.<br>
• You are more trained. <br>
• You learn a lot: you develop yourself, you challenge yourself and you explore dance and improvisation techniques. <br>
• You live a special experience (at best) with moments full of magic and flow.
<br>
• You get to know people.<br>
• You take time out and clear your head.<br>
