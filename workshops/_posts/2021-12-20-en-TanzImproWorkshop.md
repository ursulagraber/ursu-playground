## We work on 5 levels in the workshop:

<br>

## Level 1: Getting to know the body better
## Level 2: Explore dance movements
## Level 3: Create improv movements
## Level 4: Create improv movements
## Level 5: Find magic and flow

<br>


## Stufe 1: Getting to know the body better
At Level 1 we learn the basics of movement, gravity and breathing.
 **Motto: ENJOY**

## Stufe 2: Explore dance movements
Through movement chains we explore specific dance movements and their parameters on level 2. **Motto: PLEASURE OF MOVING**

## Stufe 3: Create improv movements
In level 3 we become familiar with the basics of improvisation and create our own dance movements. **Motto: CHALLENGE YOURSELF, PLAY**

## Stufe 4: Create improv movements
Building on this, we study improv factors such as time, space and music. We also learn what to do when we are not inspired.  **Motto: DELIGHTFUL DETAILS**

## Stufe 5: Find magic and flow
In level 5 we combine everything we have learned and train to find magic and flow with the help of specific exercises. **Motto: MAGIC AND FLOW**

<br>

## Aim
You are able to bring variety into your movements and create convincing and authentic improvisations. You get a picture of the movement possibilities of your body and have concrete ideas on how you can practice and expand them.
<br>

## Target group
Dancers, athletes and people who like to deal with the musculoskeletal system. People who want to find their own movements and style instead of copying ready-made dance steps.


<br>

## If that appeals to you, the workshop is for you
• The social aspect of dancing together: Because it's nice to train and dance together with other people <br>
• The beauty of learning: because it is exciting and inspiring to learn something new<br>
• he health and well-being factor: Because you feel good and fit when you move, it has a relaxing effect and endorphins are produced - and because dancing has always been a part of human life <br>
*#playing with movement*

<br>

## This is what you're getting out of it
• You feel more "in" your body..<br>
• You understand much better how to move.<br>
• You are more trained. <br>
• You learn a lot: you develop yourself, you get to know yourself better and you explore dance and improvisation techniques. <br>
• You live a special experience (at best) with moments full of magic and flow.
<br>
• You get to know people.<br>
• You take time out and clear your head.<br>
