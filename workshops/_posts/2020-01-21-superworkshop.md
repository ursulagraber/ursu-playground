Delicious Workshop!

Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. Burn her anyway! Now, look here, my good man. Be quiet!

He hasn't got shit all over him. __Now, look here, my good man.__ *Well, I got better.* …Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate?

<!--plop-->

Did you dress her up like this? What a strange person. Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.

Delicious Workshop!

Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. Burn her anyway! Now, look here, my good man. Be quiet!

He hasn't got shit all over him. __Now, look here, my good man.__ *Well, I got better.* …Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate?

What do you mean? Shut up! Shut up! Now, look here, my good man. I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!

## The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.

1. Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system!
2. The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.
3. We want a shrubbery!!

### Where'd you get the coconuts?

Did you dress her up like this? What a strange person. Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.

* The nose?
* The nose?
* Where'd you get the coconuts?

Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! Why? You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! Bring her forward! How do you know she is a witch? We found them.

How do you know she is a witch? Well, Mercia's a temperate zone! But you are dressed as one… Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits!

Well, I didn't vote for you. Who's that then? Well, I didn't vote for you. The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.

Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot! I am your king. Look, my liege! Be quiet! Burn her anyway!

A newt? No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart. We want a shrubbery!! The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.

Shut up! Will you shut up?! She looks like one. Why? She looks like one.

We want a shrubbery!! Well, Mercia's a temperate zone! Well, I didn't vote for you. Where'd you get the coconuts? The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice! Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods.

Well, we did do the nose. The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land. The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king.

A newt? Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot! I am your king. We found them.

On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place. Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.

Who's that then? I dunno. Must be a king. Who's that then? And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!
