A 15-minute dance performance with clownesque elements: "Tonight I'm going to dance!" - until it comes to that, a few things happen.

## About *Tonit'e I will'e danc'e*

This piece pays homage to the Neapolitan comedian Totò, also known as the “Prince of Laughter”. He is best known for his comic and cynical character. The piece was inspired by his primo provino cinematografico. Totò is particularly notable for his gestures, facial expressions, and movements that accompany his spoken words. These qualities form the basis of the piece, which contributes to today's interpretations of contemporary dance.
