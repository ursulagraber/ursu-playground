A solo by Ursula Graber.

This is the second collaboration with composer Diego Jiménez Tamame. The investigation tackles two extreme emotional states: on the one hand, lifestyle-diseases like burn-out and depression, on the other hand, balancing activities like snowshoeing and in general spending time in nature.
