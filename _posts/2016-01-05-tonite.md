A homage to the napoletan comedian Totò, nicknamed ‘the Prince of laughter’. Best known in his funny and sometimes cynical character, the work is inspired by his primo provino cinematografico 1930. Totò is outstanding for his gestures, facial expressions and movements accompanying his spoken word. These characteristics are the basis for this piece, which contributes to today’s contemporary dance movements interpretation.
