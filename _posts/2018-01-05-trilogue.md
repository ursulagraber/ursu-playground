Trilogue is the first cooperation between the composer Diego Jiménez Tamame, the visual artist Pol Monsó Purtí and Ursula Graber. A 3D camera live-captures and replicates the dancers movements. Additionally, the dancer is connected to the musician by a technological bracelet which, according to the dancers movements, sends signals to the electronics of the musician which influence the live music. A Trilogue between visuals, movements and music and the question of today’s technological presence in our everyday-lives.
