‘A totem is a spirit being, sacred object, or symbol that serves as an emblem of a group of people, such as a family, clan, lineage, or tribe.’ (Wikipedia)

The piece explores possible transfers of a sense of community, family and tribe into movements, paintings, music and light. Totem pictures the loss of the ratio and the access to a ritualistic, trance-like sphere.
